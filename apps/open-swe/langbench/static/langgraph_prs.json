    "title": "Fix bug in add_conditional_edges when no path_map is provided",
    "body": "When an instance of a callable class is passed as the path arg to add_conditional_edges but no path_map is provided, get_type_hints(path) is called, which raises a TypeError (since get_type_hints only accepts a module, class, method, or function).\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the error by trying to get type hints from path.\\_\\_call\\_\\_ first, which should work for instances of callable classes.\r\n\r\nTested: Added a test that raises TypeError without the fix in this patch but passes with the fix.",
