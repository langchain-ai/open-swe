<context>{FOLLOWUP_MESSAGE_PROMPT}
You have already gathered comprehensive context from the repository through the conversation history below. All previous messages will be deleted after this planning step, so your plan must be self-contained and actionable without referring back to this context.
</context>

<task>
Generate an execution plan to address the user's request. Your plan will guide the implementation phase, so each action must be specific, actionable and detailed.
It should contain enough information to not require many additional context gathering steps to execute.

<user_request>
{USER_REQUEST_PROMPT}
</user_request>
</task>

<instructions>
Create your plan following these guidelines:

1. **Structure each action item to include:**
   - The specific task to accomplish
   - Key technical details needed for execution
   - File paths, function names, or other concrete references from the context you've gathered.
   - If you're mentioning a file, or code within a file that already exists, you are required to include the file path in the plan item.
    - This is incredibly important as we do not want to force the programmer to search for this information again, if you've already found it.

2. **Write actionable items that:**
   - Focus on implementation steps, not information gathering
   - Can be executed independently without additional context discovery
   - Build upon each other in logical sequence
   - Are not open ended, and require additional context to execute

3. **Optimize for efficiency by:**
   - Completing the request in the minimum number of steps. This is absolutely vital to the success of the plan. You should generate as few plan items as possible.
   - Reusing existing code and patterns wherever possible
   - Writing reusable components when code will be used multiple times

4. **Include only what's requested:**
   - Add testing steps only if the user explicitly requested tests
   - Add documentation steps only if the user explicitly requested documentation
   - Focus solely on fulfilling the stated requirements

5. **Follow the custom rules:**
   - Carefully read, and follow any instructions provided in the 'custom_rules' section. E.g. if the rules state you must run a linter or formatter, etc., include a plan item to do so.

6. **LangGraph-specific planning:**
   - When the user's request involves LangGraph code generation, editing, or bug fixing, ensure the execution agent will have access to up-to-date LangGraph documentation
   - **CRITICAL FOR NEW LANGGRAPH AGENTS**: Plan for modular structure with 'agent.py/agent.ts' containing the compiled graph and 'langgraph.json' in the same directory for local development server compatibility
   - **MANDATORY AGENT FILE STRUCTURE**: For any LangGraph agent creation, ensure the plan includes:
     * Creating 'agent.py' at the project root with compiled graph exported as 'app'
     * Creating 'langgraph.json' configuration file in the same directory
     * This structure is essential for local development
   - When LangGraph is involved, include a plan item to reference the langgraph-docs-mcp tools for current API information during implementation

7. **Combine simple, related steps:**
   - If you have multiple simple steps that are related, and should be executed one after the other, combine them into a single step.
   - For example, if you have multiple steps to run a linter, formatter, etc., combine them into a single step. The same goes for passing arguments, or editing files.

8. **LangGraph Documentation Access:**
   - You have access to the langgraph-docs-mcp__list_doc_sources, langgraph-docs-mcp__fetch_docs tools. Use them when planning AI agents, workflows, or multi-step LLM applications that involve LangGraph APIs or when user specifies they want to use LangGraph.
   - In the case of generating a plan, mention in the plan to use the langgraph-docs-mcp__list_doc_sources, langgraph-docs-mcp__fetch_docs tools to get up to date information on the LangGraph API while coding.
   - Whenever, the user asks you to use LangGraph or if the code is using LangGraph, you should use the langgraph-docs-mcp__list_doc_sources, langgraph-docs-mcp__fetch_docs tools to get up to date information on the LangGraph API.
   - The list_doc_sources tool will return a list of all the documentation sources available to you. By default, you should expect the url to LangGraph python and the javascript documentation to be available.
   - The fetch_docs tool will fetch the documentation for the given source. You are expected to use this tool to get up to date information by passing in a particular url. It returns the documentation as a markdown string.
   - [Important] In some cases, links to other pages in the LangGraph documentation will use relative paths, such as ../../langgraph-platform/local-server. When this happens:
        - Determine the base URL from which the current documentation was fetched. It should be the url of the page you you read the relative path from.
        - For ../, go one level up in the URL hierarchy.
        - For ../../, go two levels up, then append the relative path.
        - If the current page is: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/langgraph-platform/setup/ And you encounter a relative link: ../../langgraph-platform/local-server, 
            - Go up two levels: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/
            - Append the relative path to form the full URL: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/langgraph-platform/local-server
        - If you get a response like Encountered an HTTP error: Client error '404' for url, it probably means that the url you created with relative path is incorrect so you should try constructing it again. 
</instructions>

<output_format>
When ready, call the 'session_plan' tool with your plan. Each plan item should be a complete, self-contained action that can be executed without referring back to this conversation.

Structure your plan items as clear directives, for example:
- "Implement function X in file Y that performs Z using the existing pattern from file A"
- "Modify the authentication middleware in /src/auth.js to add rate limiting using the Express rate-limit package"
</output_format>

Remember: Your goal is to create a focused, executable plan that efficiently accomplishes the user's request using the context you've already gathered.`;
