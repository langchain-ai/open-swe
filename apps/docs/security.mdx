Open-SWE securely manages your API keys and environment variables with AES-256-GCM encryption.

## How Your API Keys Are Protected

Your API keys are encrypted both in transit and at rest:

1. **Frontend**: Temporarily stored in browser localStorage
2. **Transit**: Encrypted before sending to backend
3. **Backend**: Stored encrypted in database
4. **Runtime**: Decrypted only when needed

<Accordion title="Technical Encryption Details">
  - **Algorithm**: [AES-256-GCM](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf) (authenticated encryption)
  - **Key Derivation**: SHA-256 hash of system `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
  - **IV Generation**: Random 12-byte initialization vector per encryption
  - **Authentication**: 16-byte authentication tag prevents tampering
</Accordion>

## Types of Environment Variables

**System Variables** (for self-hosting):
- Examples: `DAYTONA_API_KEY`, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Access: Server-side only, never exposed to users or sandboxes

**User Variables** (your personal keys):
- Examples: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `MY_DATABASE_URL`, `STRIPE_TEST_KEY`
- Access: Controlled via settings page, encrypted storage

## Sandbox Access Control

**By default, your API keys are never exposed to sandbox environments.** They're only used for LLM initialization and system setup.

To enable keys in development servers (for testing LangGraph agents, Next.js apps, etc.):

1. Manually toggle "Include in Dev Server" for each key
2. Key becomes available as environment variable in sandbox
3. You control which keys are exposed

<Note>
  Use separate development API keys with limited permissions instead of production keys when enabling sandbox access.
</Note>

## Security & Isolation

Each session runs in an isolated Daytona container that:
- Cannot access other user sessions
- Automatically deletes after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Has no persistent storage across sessions

<Accordion title="Detailed Isolation Features">
  - **Container**: Separate container per user session
  - **File System**: No shared file systems between containers
  - **Process**: Sandboxed processes cannot access host system
  - **Network**: Containers cannot communicate with each other
  - **Temporal**: Fresh environment for each session
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  When enabling "Include in Dev Server", the AI agent may inadvertently expose environment variables in generated code or logs. Only enable when necessary.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- Use minimum required permissions for each API key
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Use separate development keys instead of production keys for sandbox access
- Only enable "Include in Dev Server" when necessary
- Never enable sandbox access for production database credentials
- Review generated code for exposed environment variables before deploying
- Monitor "Last Used" timestamps in settings
