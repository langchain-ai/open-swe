# Welcome to Open SWE

Open SWE is an open-source cloud-based coding agent built with [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/). It's designed to autonomously understand, plan, and execute code changes across entire repositories using advanced AI capabilities.

<Note>
Open SWE is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.
</Note>

## How It Works

Open SWE operates through three specialized LangGraph components:
- **Manager Graph**: Orchestrates user interactions and coordinates between other graphs
- **Planner Graph**: Analyzes requirements and creates detailed execution plans
- **Programmer Graph**: Executes code changes based on approved plans

The agent can be used through a web interface or triggered automatically via GitHub webhooks, making it flexible for both interactive development and automated workflows.
