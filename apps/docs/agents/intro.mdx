# Agents Overview

Open SWE uses a sophisticated four-agent system to handle complex coding tasks from initial request to final implementation. This architecture mirrors how experienced development teams work together, with each agent specializing in a specific aspect of the software development lifecycle.

## The Four-Agent System

### **Manager Agent**

**Role**: Entry point and intelligent router  
**Purpose**: Receives user requests, initializes GitHub issues, and routes messages to the appropriate specialized agents based on context and current system state.

### **Planner Agent**

**Role**: Strategic planning and analysis  
**Purpose**: Analyzes codebases, gathers context, and generates comprehensive implementation plans that break down complex requests into actionable tasks.

### **Programmer Agent**

**Role**: Code implementation and execution  
**Purpose**: Executes approved plans by making code changes, running tests, managing dependencies, and handling all implementation details.

### **Reviewer Agent**

**Role**: Quality assurance and feedback  
**Purpose**: Reviews code changes, provides feedback, and ensures quality standards are met before completion.

## Agent Workflow

The agents collaborate in a structured workflow that ensures thorough analysis, careful implementation, and quality assurance:

```
User Request   →   Manager   →   Planner   →   Programmer   →   Reviewer   →   Pull Request
                    ↑               ↑              ↑                 ↑      ↓
                    Routes to       Generates      Implements        Provides
                    appropriate       plan           changes         feedback
                    agent
```

### Detailed Flow

1. **Request Reception**: Manager receives and classifies user requests, determining the appropriate routing strategy
2. **Plan Generation**: Planner analyzes the codebase, gathers context, and creates detailed implementation plans
3. **Plan Approval**: Plans are presented for human review and approval (unless in auto mode)
4. **Implementation**: Programmer executes the approved plan through systematic code changes
5. **Quality Review**: Reviewer analyzes changes and provides feedback for improvements
6. **Iteration**: Programmer addresses feedback until quality standards are met
7. **Completion**: Automatic pull request creation with all changes and documentation

## Key Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent focuses on its specialized domain
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in review process ensures code quality
- **Scalability**: Complex tasks are systematically broken down and executed

This architecture enables Open SWE to handle sophisticated coding requests while maintaining high quality standards.
