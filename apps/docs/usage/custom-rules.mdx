description: Configure Open SWE with project-specific rules using AGENTS.md

# Custom Rules

Custom rules allow you to provide project-specific context and guidelines to Open SWE through configuration files in your repository root.

## What is AGENTS.md?

`AGENTS.md` is a configuration file that tells Open SWE about your project's:
- Coding standards and conventions
- Repository structure and architecture
- Dependencies and installation procedures
- Testing frameworks and practices
- Pull request formatting requirements

## Why Use Custom Rules?

Custom rules help Open SWE:
- Follow your project's specific conventions
- Understand your codebase architecture
- Use the correct package managers and tools
- Write tests that match your testing patterns
- Generate properly formatted pull requests

Without custom rules, Open SWE uses generic best practices that may not align with your project.

## Supported Sections

### `<general_rules>`

Project-specific coding standards and conventions:
- Package manager preferences (e.g., "Always use Yarn")
- Code style requirements
- Import/export patterns
- Architectural guidelines

### `<repository_structure>`

Description of your codebase organization:
- Monorepo vs single package structure
- Key directories and their purposes
- Package relationships and dependencies
- Build system configuration

### `<dependencies_and_installation>`

Package management and setup instructions:
- Package manager commands
- Installation procedures
- Key dependencies and their purposes
- Workspace configuration details

### `<testing_instructions>`

Testing framework and practices:
- Test runner configuration (Jest, Vitest, etc.)
- Test file naming conventions
- How to run different test types
- Testing best practices for your project

### `<pull_request_formatting>`

PR creation and formatting guidelines:
- Title and description templates
- Required sections or checklists
- Review process requirements
- Linking conventions

## File Names

Open SWE reads custom rules from these files (in order of precedence):

1. `AGENTS.md` (recommended)
2. `AGENT.md`
3. `CLAUDE.md`
4. `CURSOR.md`

<Note>
  Use `AGENTS.md` as the standard filename for consistency across projects.
</Note>

## Missing Sections

If your custom rules file doesn't include XML section tags:
- The entire file content becomes `generalRules`
- Other sections remain empty
- Open SWE still benefits from the general guidance provided

## Formatting Example

```markdown
<general_rules>
- Always use Yarn as the package manager
- Follow strict TypeScript practices
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality
</general_rules>

<repository_structure>
This is a Yarn workspace monorepo with three main packages:
- apps/web: Next.js frontend
- apps/api: Express backend
- packages/shared: Common utilities
</repository_structure>

<dependencies_and_installation>
Run `yarn install` from the repository root to install all dependencies.
Key dependencies include React 18, TypeScript, and Jest for testing.
</dependencies_and_installation>

<testing_instructions>
- Run `yarn test` for unit tests
- Run `yarn test:e2e` for end-to-end tests
- Test files use `.test.ts` extension
- Use Jest with React Testing Library
</testing_instructions>

<pull_request_formatting>
PR titles should follow: "feat: description" or "fix: description"
Include a brief description and link any related issues.
</pull_request_formatting>
```

## Getting Started

1. Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your repository root
2. Add relevant sections using XML-style tags
3. Include project-specific guidelines and conventions
4. Test with Open SWE to ensure it follows your rules

<Tip>
  Start with `<general_rules>` and `<repository_structure>` sections, then add others as needed.
