# Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to get the best results from Open SWE.

## Prompting Tips

### Be Clear and Direct

- Include specific file paths and function names in your requests
- Provide concrete examples of what you want to achieve
- Avoid vague language like "improve" or "optimize" without specifics

### Create Custom Rules

Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your repository root to provide project-specific context. This helps Open SWE understand your codebase conventions and requirements.

<Tip>
  See the [Custom Rules](/usage/custom-rules) page for detailed guidance on setting up your AGENTS.md file.
</Tip>

### Keep Tasks Well-Scoped

- Focus on one specific feature or fix per request
- Break large changes into smaller, manageable tasks
- Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes in a single request

### Avoid Multiple Tasks

Submit separate requests for different features or fixes. This allows Open SWE to:
- Generate more focused plans
- Provide better error handling
- Make changes easier to review

## Model Selection

### Claude Sonnet 4 (Default)

Use for most coding tasks:
- Standard feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Code refactoring
- Documentation updates

### Claude Opus 4 (Complex Tasks)

Use for challenging problems requiring advanced reasoning:
- Complex architectural changes
- Performance optimization
- Advanced algorithm implementation
- Multi-system integrations

### Avoid Other Models

Open SWE's prompts are specifically tuned for Claude models. Other models may produce suboptimal results.

## Mode Selection

### open-swe vs open-swe-max

**open-swe**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4
- Suitable for most development tasks
- Faster execution
- Cost-effective

**open-swe-max**: Uses Claude Opus 4
- For complex tasks requiring advanced reasoning
- Higher quality output for challenging problems
- More expensive but better for difficult tasks

### Auto vs Manual Labels

**Auto Mode (`-auto` labels)**

Use for most tasks:
- Open SWE excels at planning
- Faster turnaround
- Good for straightforward implementations

**Manual Mode (no `-auto` suffix)**

Use for extremely complex tasks:
- Allows plan review before execution
- Better for critical or sensitive changes
- Provides opportunity to modify plans

## Label Reference

- `open-swe`: Manual mode with Sonnet 4
- `open-swe-auto`: Auto mode with Sonnet 4
- `open-swe-max`: Manual mode with Opus 4
- `open-swe-max-auto`: Auto mode with Opus 4

<Note>
  In development environments, append `-dev` to all labels (e.g., `open-swe-dev`, `open-swe-auto-dev`).
