<Warning>
  GitLab webhooks are _not_ available via the demo application. To use GitLab webhooks, you must set up your own instance of Open SWE following the [development setup guide](/labs/swe/setup/development).
</Warning>

# GitLab Webhook Integration

Open SWE integrates seamlessly with GitLab through webhooks, allowing you to trigger automated code changes directly from GitLab issues. This provides a streamlined workflow where you can request code changes by simply adding labels to issues in projects where Open SWE is configured. GitLab integration works with both GitLab.com and self-hosted GitLab instances.

## Triggering Runs with Labels

Open SWE monitors GitLab issues for specific labels that trigger automated runs. When you add one of these labels to an issue, Open SWE will automatically create a new run to process your request.

### Label Types

Open SWE supports the same label types for GitLab as it does for GitHub:

**Manual Mode (`open-swe`)**

- Requires manual approval of the generated plan before code execution
- Gives you full control over what changes will be made
- Ideal for complex or sensitive changes where you want to review the approach first

**Auto Mode (`open-swe-auto`)**

- Automatically approves and executes the generated plan
- Provides faster turnaround for straightforward requests
- Best for simple changes or when you trust the agent to proceed autonomously

**Max Mode (`open-swe-max` and `open-swe-max-auto`)**

- Uses Claude Opus 4.1 for both planning and programming tasks
- Provides enhanced performance and reasoning capabilities for complex problems
- `open-swe-max`: Requires manual plan approval with premium model performance
- `open-swe-max-auto`: Combines automatic execution with premium model capabilities
- Ideal for challenging tasks that benefit from the most advanced AI reasoning

<Note>
  In development environments, the labels are `open-swe-dev`,
  `open-swe-auto-dev`, `open-swe-max-dev`, and `open-swe-max-auto-dev`
  respectively. The system automatically uses the appropriate labels based on
  the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
</Note>

## Automatic Run Creation

When you add a supported label to a GitLab issue, Open SWE's webhook handler automatically:

1. **Validates the request** - Verifies webhook tokens and authentication
2. **Extracts issue context** - Captures the issue title, description, and metadata
3. **Creates a new thread** - Generates a unique thread ID for the conversation
4. **Starts the Manager Graph** - Initiates the agent workflow with the issue content
5. **Configures execution mode** - Sets auto-accept based on the label type used

The entire process happens within seconds of adding the label, providing immediate feedback through issue comments.

## Issue Comments and Run Links

Once a run is created, Open SWE automatically posts a comment on the triggering issue to confirm processing has started. This comment includes:

- **Status confirmation** - "🤖 Open SWE has been triggered for this issue. Processing..."
- **Run link** - Direct URL to view the run in the Open SWE web interface
- **Access restriction notice** - Clarifies that only the issue creator can access the run
- **Development metadata** - Run ID and thread ID for debugging (in a collapsible section)

<Tip>
  The run link allows you to monitor progress in real-time, view the generated
  plan, and interact with the agent if needed. You can switch between manual and
  auto mode even after the run has started.
</Tip>

## User Access Restrictions

Open SWE implements strict access controls to ensure security and privacy:

### Issue Creator Access

- **Only the user who created the issue** can access the generated run URL
- This prevents unauthorized users from viewing or modifying runs triggered by others
- Access is enforced through GitLab authentication and user verification

### Project Permissions

- Open SWE respects GitLab's project permissions
- Users must have appropriate access to the project to trigger runs
- The GitLab access token determines which projects can use Open SWE

<Note>
  If you need to share access to a run with team members, you can do so through
  the Open SWE web interface after the run is created, or by having team members
  with project access create their own issues.
</Note>

## Merge Request Integration

When Open SWE successfully completes code changes, it automatically creates merge requests that are linked back to the original issue:

### Automatic MR Creation

- **Generated after plan execution** - MRs are created once the Programmer Graph completes its work
- **Linked to triggering issue** - MRs reference the original issue in their description
- **Preserves commit history** - All intermediate commits are maintained for transparency

### Issue Resolution

- **Automatic closure** - When the generated MR is merged, GitLab automatically closes the linked issue
- **Clear audit trail** - The connection between issue, run, and MR provides complete traceability
- **Status updates** - Issue comments track the progress from request to completion

<Tip>
  You can review the generated MR before merging, even in auto mode. The
  auto-accept setting only applies to plan approval, not MR merging, giving you
  final control over what code enters your project.
</Tip>

## Merge Request Comments

Open SWE also supports triggering runs directly from merge request comments:

### Mentioning the Agent

- **Use `@open-swe`** (or your configured trigger username) in an MR comment to request changes
- The agent will process your request and update the MR accordingly
- Plans are auto-accepted for MR comment triggers

<Note>
  Make sure to tag the configured trigger username in your GitLab project. The
  default is `@open-swe`, but this can be customized via the
  `GITLAB_TRIGGER_USERNAME` environment variable.
</Note>

## Self-Hosted GitLab Support

Open SWE fully supports self-hosted GitLab instances:

### Configuration

Set the `GITLAB_BASE_URL` environment variable to your GitLab instance URL:

```bash
GITLAB_BASE_URL="https://gitlab.your-company.com"
```

### Requirements

- GitLab CE/EE version 13.0 or higher
- API access enabled
- Webhook support enabled

<Tip>
  Self-hosted GitLab instances work identically to GitLab.com, with the same
  features and capabilities.
</Tip>

## Getting Started

To start using Open SWE with GitLab webhooks:

1. **Configure GitLab OAuth** in your Open SWE instance
2. **Set up webhook integration** in your GitLab project
3. **Create a detailed issue** describing the changes you want
4. **Add the appropriate label** (`open-swe` for manual mode or `open-swe-auto` for automatic mode)
5. **Monitor the issue comments** for the run link and status updates
6. **Review and merge the MR** when Open SWE completes the changes

For setup instructions, see the [Development Setup](/labs/swe/setup/development) guide.

## Differences from GitHub

While the GitLab integration mirrors GitHub functionality, there are some key differences:

### Terminology

- **Merge Requests (MRs)** instead of Pull Requests (PRs)
- **Projects** instead of Repositories
- **Notes** instead of Comments

### Authentication

- Uses GitLab **Personal Access Tokens** instead of GitHub App installation
- OAuth flow is similar but uses GitLab's OAuth provider

### Webhooks

- GitLab webhooks use **token-based authentication** instead of HMAC signatures
- Configure webhook token in `GITLAB_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` environment variable

<Note>
  Despite these differences, the Open SWE provider abstraction ensures a
  consistent experience across both platforms.
