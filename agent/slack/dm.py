"""Bot DMs, optionally run in concierge mode: one conversation instead of a thread per message.

Off unless the person turns on ``concierge_mode`` in their own preferences. When
it is on, the conversation is keyed with the same non-message timestamp code
channels and incident channels use, so replies post into the DM instead of
opening a thread and the channel's own history is the conversation transcript. That
timestamp is also how the rest of the code recognizes the mode: only a DM the
owner enabled ever reaches a run with it.
